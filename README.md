### Video Processing Pipeline

This project contains a modular pipeline to extract several facial features from videos such as face landmarks, eye gaze direction, head pose and Action Units. 
Each module in the pipeline extracts a specific facial feature for each face detected in the video frame. 
These features can be used to obtain information about a person's facial expressions, facial movements, gaze and emotions. 
The `video_processing_pipeline` folder contains code and detailed documentation for the project.  
This work is part of a larger project which aims to use multimodal features to detect and characterize emotion in videos.
